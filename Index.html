                        As a long-time musician, I've always had a deep attachment to the stage, but was never really attached to the performing elements of it.
                        Since 2017 though, photography has given me the connection to the performing arts from behind the guise of a lens. Sadly, COVID-19 ended
                        the work for many photographers in the music industry and as such I had to look elsewhere. <br>
                        <br>
                        Studying at Collarts and experiencing many different parts of the creative industry has led me to feel a deeper level of confidence with my 
                        creativity and work with and for some amazing people so far. If you click <a href="Contact.html" target='_blank'>here</a> you can get in contact 
                        with me so we can talk about the amazing things we can potentially create together!</p>
